# Hopfield Network Simulation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple Hopfield network simulation. Hopfield networks are a type of recurrent artificial neural network that can be used for associative memory.

# Overview
The simulation allows you to load images from the img/ folder, preprocess them using the provided preprocessing.py script, and then store the patterns in the Hopfield network. The network can then be queried to recall stored patterns or complete partial patterns.
